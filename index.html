    <p>  My name is Max, I am Ukrainian. I'm 26, I live in Ireland. I came to Ireland on the August 2022. I help Letterkenny Intercultural Platform as an interpreter.</p>

    <p> I have studied as an English interpreter and as a Social Media Marketing manager. In July 2022 I finished an academy where I learned leadership and soft skills. I also was there as an English teacher and tutor for people from different countries there.  I have also been a volunteer for 2 years in the years 2016-2018 in Northern Ireland and Scotland.</p>
        
    <p>I'm a religious person, no bad habits. I find myself as a social person. I have many hobbies like archery, drone operating, playing guitar, cooking, swimming and cycling. I also enjoy travelling and a good company of my friends and fiancÃ©. </p>
